# EI_BITCOIN

# WELCOME, 

Here I implemented during my integration study two methods in order to try to predict the price of the bitcoin using two methods : 
- RNN method 
- a statistical method (ARIMA, ARIMAX, SARIMAX)


## RNN method

The document 'final_rnn.ipynb' allows you to choose a set of parameters for your RNN, 
once you run the code, the model trains itself and then you obtain three types of results:
- the RMSE which gives an idea of the error commited by the model
- the curve to see visually if the prediction matchs the true values
- the virtual benefits obtained with a simple trading algorithm

## Statstical method

The document 'statistical_prediction.ipynb' shows the use of the diffrent statistical methods we used to predict bitcoin prices
